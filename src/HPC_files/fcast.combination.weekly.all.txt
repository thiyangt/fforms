In addition: Warning messages:
1: In auto.arima(training, seasonal = TRUE) :
  Stepwise search was stopped early due to reaching the model number limit: `nmodels = 94`
2: In bats(as.numeric(y), use.box.cox = use.box.cox, use.trend = use.trend,  :
  optim() did not converge.
3: In auto.arima(training, seasonal = TRUE) :
  Having 3 or more differencing operations is not recommended. Please consider reducing the total number of differences.
4: The chosen seasonal unit root test encountered an error when testing for the first difference.
From stl(): series is not periodic or has less than two periods
0 seasonal differences will be used. Consider using a different unit root test.
